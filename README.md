# palindrome-checker-java
Client-Server Application used to check whether a string is a palindrome or not.

## Question (Punjab University LQ #2 2017):
A client wants to send a request to server for checking that a string is a palindrome or not. So, you have to make a server-client application, in which client sends a string to the server and server resends the response in which it tells that the given string is palindrome or not.(Do your task with serialization method in which either you can use built-in calss String or make your own string class).
